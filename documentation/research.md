# Telepresence Robot Brain Dump

Preliminary research on the current state of the art of telepresence robotics. Brainstorming things that we hope to achieve, features, concerns.

## Working definitions

A starting point for understanding the main terms and topics involved.

### Telepresence

> Telepresence refers to a set of technologies which allow a person to feel as if they were present, to give the appearance of being present, or to have an effect, via telerobotics, at a place other than their true location.
> 
> Telepresence requires that the users' senses be provided with such stimuli as to give the feeling of being in that other location. Additionally, users may be given the ability to affect the remote location. In this case, the user's position, movements, actions, voice, etc. may be sensed, transmitted and duplicated in the remote location to bring about this effect. Therefore information may be traveling in both directions between the user and the remote location.

### Telerobotics

> Telerobotics is the area of robotics concerned with the control of semi-autonomous robots from a distance, chiefly using Wireless network (like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, the Deep Space Network, and similar) or tethered connections. It is a combination of two major subfields, teleoperation and telepresence.

### Teleoperation

> Teleoperation (or remote operation) indicates operation of a system or machine at a distance...

-- [source: wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleoperation)

### Robotics

> Robotics is an interdisciplinary research area at the interface of computer science[1] and engineering. Robotics involves design, construction, operation, and use of robots.

### Robots

> A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.[2] Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within.
> 
> Robots can be autonomous or semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such as Honda's Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility (ASIMO) and TOSY's TOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot (TOPIO) to industrial robots, medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmed swarm robots, UAV drones such as General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopic nano robots.

### Telepresence Robot

>“Technology that lets a human “inhabit” the body of a distant robot for remote exploration..."

-- Tom Simonite of NewScientist

>In the simplest form of an answer, a Telepresence Robot is basically a wheeled ‘Skype’ machine. 

>Also referred to as Virtual Presence Robots, Telepresence robot enables the user to extend their presence anywhere and anytime... to interact with the other party...

-- [source: robots.net](https://robots.net/tech-reviews/what-are-telepresence-robots-and-how-they-benefit-us/)

>A telepresence robot is a device that allows a remote user to dial into an audio/video conference and additionally allow them to drive the robot to various locations and look up/down, left/right to interact with other people and the environment in which the device is located.

>Telepresence robots allow you to be in remote locations without having to physically go there. It allows you to attend meetings or classes, visit family members in assisted living facilities or retirement homes, provide remote tech support or receptionist/hospitality services in various distant locations throughout the world all in the same day. Not only does it save a great deal of time and travel cost but it allows you to be where the telepresece [sic] robot is in an instant!

* A more seamless experience for self-guided exploration than afforded by conventional pan-tilt systems
* To enable people to have agentive power in remote locations of their choosing.
* To extend the act of communication into an embodied form over distances.
* Giving people the ability to access and have some form of encounter with circumstances and locations that are drastically different or opposed to their own.
* To improve collaborative work over distances by providing a sense of physical presence between team members.

## Affordances

* Vision
* Hearing
* Speech/Voice
* Mobility
* Limbs
	* pointing
	* influencing environment
	* manipulating objects

	* self defense?
* Dexterity

### Vision

* Dual 360 (possibly 180) degree camera system that enables stereoscopic, VR view of the telepresence robot's location.
* IR sensors for object detection
* CV for scene analysis and input to motion systems

### Hearing

* Ambisonic microphone array in order to facilitate an accurate spatial reconstruction of the telepresence robot's sonic environment.

### Voice/Speech

* Most communication will occur with a human "inhabiting" the robot.

## Privacy Concerns
* Unwanted spying or eavesdropping
	* Live Camera Indicator (connected to device power)
	* Live Mic Indicator (connected to device power)
	* Video Mute switch/command
	* Audio Mute switch/command
* Mobility into restricted or private areas
	* Establish privileged spatial access
	* "Paralyze" robot command
	* "Kill" remote access command

## Security Concerns

* Access Control
* Encrypted Connections
* Theft of Robot
* Physical Access to Ports
* Physical Access to Hardware
* Securing default settings
	* Zero access by default
	* Users must be credentialed
* Privileged feature access
