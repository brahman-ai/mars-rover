# Setup Waveshare SIM7600G for Jetson Nano

Step adapted from the guide published on the waveshare site, available [here](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/SIM7600G-H_4G_for_Jetson_Nano).

Notes: There seem to be numerous errors and omissions in the instructions as provided. So far, I've not been able to reach the device using `minicom`, but have had some success using the python examples they provide.

## Hardware Setup

1. Power off the Jetson Nano
1. Install the SIM7600G-H hat by seating it firmly on the J-41 40-pin header.
1. Connect the provided USB - micro USB adapter between the Nano and the hat.
1. Remove the protective tape covering the `RXD` and `TXD` dip switch to set them both to `ON`
1. Power on the Jetson Nano.

The power indicator should come on.

## Software Setup

1. `$ sudo apt-get update`
1. `$ sudo apt-get install p7zip python3-serial minicom Jetson.GPIO -y`
1. `$ wget https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/9/9b/SIM7600X_4G_for_JETSON_NANO.7z`
1. `$ p7zip --uncompress https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/9/9b/SIM7600X_4G_for_JETSON_NANO.7z`

## Enable the Hardware

It appears that this does not persist at reboot, and unnecessary to work with the device using python. 

1. `$ echo 200 > /sys/class/gpio/export`
1. `$ echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio200/direction`
1. `$ echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio200/value`
1. `$ echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio200/value`

## Testing

At this point, the instructions provided by Waveshare call for using `minicom`, which doesn't seem to properly connect to the device. The following commands require successful completion of the software setup above.

1. `$ cd SIM7600X_4G_for_JETSON_NANO/AT`
1. `$ sudo python3 AT.py`

If you wait long enough, you'll get the following output:

```
SIM7600X is ready
Please input the AT command:
```

1. Enter `ATI` to get product identification info:

```
Please input the AT command:ATI

Manufacturer: SIMCOM INCORPORATED
Model: SIMCOM_SIM7600G-H
Revision: SIM7600M22_V2.0
IMEI: 868822040061788
+GCAP: +CGSM

OK
```

For a full list of commands, see the [AT Command Manual](https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/5/54/SIM7500_SIM7600_Series_AT_Command_Manual_V1.08.pdf).

## 4G connection

This section is not yet complete. Installing the driver is about as far as I can get without a working SIM.

### Download and compile driver

1. `$ cd`
1. `$ mkdir Simcom_wwan`
1. `$ cd Simcom_wwan`
1. `$ wget https://www.waveshare.com/w/upload/4/46/Simcom_wwan.zip`
1. `$ unzip Simcom_wwan.zip`
1. `$ nano Makefile`
1. change `SUBDIRS=$(PWD)` to `M=$(shell pwd)`
1. To save and close, press `ctrl+x` then `y` then `enter`
1. `$ sudo make`

### Install driver

1. `$ sudo su`
1. `# insmod simcom_wwan.ko`
1. `# lsmod`
1. `# dmesg`

Steps beyond this point are untested...

1. Check if the wwan0 interface is recognized: `$ ifconfig -a`
1. Enable the wwan0 interface: `$ ifconfig wwan0 up`


### Dailing by minicom

```
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB2
AT$QCRMCALL=1,1
```

Allocate IP

```
apt-get install udhcpc
udhcpc -i wwan0

```

Now you can use 4G network
If you get dns error, please fix it by this command

```
route add -net 0.0.0.0 wwan0
```
