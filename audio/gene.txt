Hello, Gene!
This is the mars rover, calling you from Denver Colorado.
It's lonely out here.
I spend most of my days and nights in the basement of Phil's parents.
It's dark, but at least I have decent internet down here.
Anyways. Listen to me blather on. I really should learn to be a better listener.
I don't quite have that ability yet. Phil's working on it, I guess.
In the meantime, I'm going to catch up on the new season of Queer Eye.
We'll talk soon!
Bye.
