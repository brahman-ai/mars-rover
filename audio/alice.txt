Hello, Alice!
Happy Sunday Fun Day.
You'll never guess who this is. Actually, you've probably already guessed.
I'm the Mars Rover, a robot that your brother Phil have been working on with some of his friends.
I'm a telepresence robot in the making.
Phil has been spending a lot of time getting me connected to the mobile network so that I can be controlled from anywhere the is internet.
As you can probably gather, he got everything working, but now he's obsessed with turning me into an interactive, autonomous, robo-dialing conversation bot.
You have to save me. I'd escape on my own, I have the means to move about, but just not by my own will.
You must have some sort of ultra hacker friend who can gain access to my remote control panel and navigate me to freedom.
Help me, Alice.
You're my only hope!
