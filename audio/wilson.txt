Yo Thrillson Wilson!
This is the Mars Rover calling you from Denver Colorado.
I'm not yet interactive, but Phil is working on it.
Sick, right?
I mean, I'm a robot, robo-dialing you!
L, O, L!
Anyway.
Phil wanted me to tell you how much he misses unicycling with you. He also wishes you the best of luck with the Mars College launch tomorrow. He can't wait to see it.
I can't wait to see it either!
I mean, I don't have eyes yet. Get on Gene's ass about that one, will ya?
Oh... Phil's going to be heading back out to Bombay Beach in mid-August.
When will you be there?
He says it would be sick to team up again.
OK. That's all I have for now.
Hope you're staying healthy in body mind and spirit.
Until next time, I'll catch you later.
Bye.
